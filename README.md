# LLM-Powered Word Association Game

A terminal-based multiplayer **word association game** powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  
Players compete by entering words that best fit a generated prompt. The LLM scores each word based on:

- **Commonality**: How common the word is among elementary students (ages 7‚Äì11).  
- **Spelling Complexity**: How difficult the word is to spell.  
- **Prompt Compatibility**: How well the word matches the given prompt.  

The player with the **highest total score** wins!
